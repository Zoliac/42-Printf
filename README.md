This project mimics the printf function from the <stdio.h> library.

I had to be able to handle the cspdiuxX% conversions.

You have to use it like that :
  - You have to make a main function in the mainft.c
  - You gotta type make in the terminal to be able to compile the files
  - You have to then compile the libftprintf.a to execute it
  - And finally you have to execute the a.out file by doing ./a.out in the terminal window.
